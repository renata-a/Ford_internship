This is to help set up JavaFx(for JDK 11 and higher)

https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ (choose an SDK and download the file fit for your computer)
Unzip the file and copy the adress of "Lib" folder
Go to Eclipse, hit "Windows" and under that, "Preferences"
Type "User Libraries" in the search and click "User Libraries" under "Java > Build Path"
Click "New" and call it "JavaFX"
Click on the library you made and then click "Add External JARs"
Scroll until you find the JavaFX SDK you made
Go to the lib folder and select all the .jar files (Do not select src.zip)
Click "Apply and Close"

Create a new Java Project
Hit "Next"
Click the "Libraries" tab and select "Add Library"
Click "User Library" and then "Next"
Find the library you just created and check its checkbox and then press "Finish"

Now go to the "Run" icon and select the drop down until you reach "Run Configurations"
Click the "Arguments" tab and go to the "VM arguments" tab
Add these two arguments
--module-path(path to the lib folder in JavaFX)
--add-modules javafx.controls
Do not include the () in the first argument, just paste the location
Select "Apply" and then "Run"
You should have now downloaded JavaFX onto Eclipse
(I only have the knowledge to download this onto Eclipse)
